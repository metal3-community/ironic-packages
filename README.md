### Package Building

Packages are automatically built using [Melange](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange) when changes are detected in the YAML package definitions. The build process:

1. **Change Detection**: Monitors changes to `*.yaml` files and related build configuration
1. **Multi-Architecture Build**: Builds packages for both x86_64 and aarch64 architectures
1. **Multi-Distribution**: Creates packages for both Alpine Linux and Wolfi
1. **Repository Publishing**: Publishes the built packages to GitHub Pages with proper APK index files

### Automated Package Updates

The repository includes comprehensive automation for keeping package definitions up to date:

- **Scheduled Updates**: GitHub Actions automatically check for new upstream versions twice daily
- **Renovate Integration**: Renovate bot monitors dependencies and creates update PRs
- **Auto-Building**: Updated packages are automatically built and published when PRs are merged
- **Manual Tools**: Scripts available for local testing and manual updates

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for detailed information about the automation system.

### Manual Building

```bash
# Generate signing key
